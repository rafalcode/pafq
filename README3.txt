I go back to pafqz in order to print reads that are over a certain size.

Meaningless pehraps in Illumina, but quite necessary in minion.

And you knwo what I try to hack something out, and it's a mess.

I've been in there already htnmling some stuff.
but now the prtele,
well it doesn't include the + btwn the sequence and quality scores.
and alot worse still, the quality scores do not haev the sme number of charaters as the sequence

OK I remember ... I wanted to feed pafqz several fastqz and output the totals.
yes well all that should come in the form of options,
which needs time to do.
